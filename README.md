- 👋 Hillo there, my name is Vasil and I'm new to programming!
- 👀 I’m interested in programming (obviously), bodybuilding, playing the guitar, cooking, MTBs, and honestly a lot of other things. I'm pretty much an experimenter.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# as my first language. After that I will probably try out C++ and see where I go from there. Subject to change tho 
- 📫 How to reach me:
